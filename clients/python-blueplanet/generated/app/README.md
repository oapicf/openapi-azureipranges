# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m openapi_server
```

```
http://localhost:8080/download/7/1/d/71d86715-5596-4529-9b13-da13a5de5b63/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/download/7/1/d/71d86715-5596-4529-9b13-da13a5de5b63/swagger.json
